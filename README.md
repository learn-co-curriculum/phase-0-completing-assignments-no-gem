# Complete Your First Software Engineering Assignment

## Learning Goals

- Understand the steps needed to complete an assignment and submit it in Canvas.

## Introduction

During this course, you will work on various assignments as you learn to code.
All assignments will be interactive pieces of curriculum that require some work.
Some assignments may ask you to follow a set of instructions, while others will
ask you to figure out your own solution to pass specific tests. This lesson is
your first assignment!

All assignments are hosted on GitHub. In order to work on them, however, you
will need to complete work on your local machine. The general process is:

- Go to the assignment's GitHub page.
- Create a personal copy (a _fork_) of the assignment.
- Download your personal copy (referred to as _cloning_) to your environment.
- Complete the required work (including passing any tests).
- Upload the work you've done to your personal copy of the assignment on GitHub.
- Submit the assignment in Canvas.

For this assignment, we'll get you set up to complete and submit your
assignments. We'll also do a quick walkthrough of the steps so you will know
what to do in future assignments.

### A Quick Note on Organizing Work on Your Machine

Through this course, you will be downloading many assignments, so it is
important to take a moment now to think about how you'll organize this work on
your computer. You are welcome to do what you like, but we recommend setting up
a directory where you can keep all of your work for this course.

- Go to your terminal and navigate to your home directory by typing `cd ~`.
- Create a `Development` folder by typing `mkdir Development` (if you're a mac
  user, this folder already exists).
- Navigate into this folder with `cd Development`.
- In here, create a `code` folder with `mkdir code`.
- Navigate into this folder with `cd code`.

You'll be going through multiple phases in this course, so it may also be
helpful to go one step further and create folders for phases 0 through 5 within
`code`.

Having a specific place for your work will make it easier to find if you ever
need to look back at an earlier project. It'll also keep the rest of your
computer's folders clear of random code.

> **Note:** The process we'll go through in this lesson will create sub-folders
> automatically. Whenever you are starting a new assignment, navigate back to
> your main `code` folder (`cd ~/Development/code`) to ensure these sub-folders
> don't get created _within each other_.

## Forking and Cloning Assignments

All the lessons in this course have a corresponding repository in GitHub. On
this page in Canvas, you should see three icons in the **upper right** corner.
The first says **Fork**. The second is a button that looks like a large-headed
cat (GitHub's 'Octocat' icon); this button will open the lesson's GitHub repo
_without_ forking. The third is a flag, which you can use to submit an _issue_
for the lesson (e.g., if you find a typo or other error).

One way to fork an assignment is to click the Octocat button to go to the
assignment's GitHub repo and fork directly from that page. (We'll go through
that process in a later lesson.) However, the easiest way to fork the assignment
is by clicking the **Fork** button at the top of the page. It looks like this:

![fork link](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/fork-link.png)

Clicking the **Fork** button will do one of two things â€” it will either start
the forking process or bring you to a page where you select where to create your
fork. If you're prompted to choose, select your personal GitHub account. The
forking process will begin and may take a few moments. When complete, you will
be redirected to a new copy of the assignment that exists under _your_ GitHub
account.

Forking is a process which creates an exact copy of a collection of code and
files. Once you've created a fork on your own GitHub account, you will be able
to edit the files in the repository and write your own code solution without
interfering with the original copy.

Go ahead and fork this assignment. The `README.md` file in the repository
contains these instructions, so you can continue here or in GitHub.

With a fork created, the next step is to download your new repository to your
local machine.

### Cloning to Your Local Machine

To download the repository for this lesson, make sure you're in your personal
fork on GitHub, then click the **Code** button. A pop-up will appear which shows
several options for cloning: **HTTPS**, **SSH**, and **GitHub CLI**. **Before
doing anything else**, be sure to switch to **SSH**. With **SSH** selected, you
should see what looks sort of like an email in the box below, starting with
`git@github.com:`. You should see your GitHub name after the `:`.

> **Aside:** Why SSH? If you followed the setup instructions, you have added
> your personal SSH key to GitHub. GitHub will store your personal copies of all
> the work you do in this course. Because you've added your SSH key, GitHub will
> know who you are when you send work from your local machine to GitHub to be
> stored. Using HTTPS instead would require you to sign in from your terminal
> using your log-in credentials each time you try to push your code to GitHub;
> it also may not work at all for some assignments.

From here, click the copy button.

![clone-repo](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-0/completing-assignments/clone-repo.gif)

Now, open your terminal and navigate to where you'd like to download the
assignment (e.g. `cd ~/Development/code/phase-0`). Type `git clone` and a space,
then paste in the copied SSH link from GitHub. It should look something like
this:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-user-name>/phase-0-completing-assignments-learn-lab-gem.git
```

Press enter, and you should see a flurry of terminal activity. Once the terminal
gives you control to type again, a new folder with the GitHub name of the
assignment will be present. Change directory into this folder to access the
assignment files.

```console
$ cd phase-0-completing-assignments-no-gem
```

Now, if you've set up VS Code, type `code .` to open up a text editor window
with access to all of the assignment's files. The instructions are now also
available on your local machine in `README.md`.

> Note: the first time you open a directory in Visual Studio Code, you'll see a
> message asking "Do you trust the authors of the files in this folders?" This
> is a [security feature][workspace-trust] of Visual Studio Code. It's safe to
> choose "Yes", and we recommend selecting the "Trust the authors of all the
> files in the parent folder" option to prevent this warning from coming up
> every time you open a lesson. Just be sure to download your code from trusted
> sources!

## Running the Tests

Most assignments will have tests that check your work and provide immediate
feedback in the terminal; that feedback will help you figure out what you need
to do to get the tests passing. We'll walk through some examples in upcoming
lessons.

For each assignment, before you can run the tests, you need to install the
_dependencies_ the test package requires. To install the dependencies for this
lab, run the following:

```console
$ npm install
```

This assignment has a single test that checks to see if you've correctly cloned
the assignment to your local machine. If you've followed the steps above, you've
completed everything you need to do to pass the test; all that is left to do is
run it:

```console
$ npm test
```

You should see the following:

![test passing message and token](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-0/enterprise/configuring-the-learn-lab-gem/test-passing.png)

Note that, by cloning this assignment down, you've already passed the test!

> **Note:** If you did not receive a passing test, or if your terminal produced
> some sort of error, walk through the steps in this lesson again and make sure
> you've followed each one. If you're still receiving errors, we recommend going
> back through the local environment setup instructions again to ensure
> everything is set up properly.

## Uploading Your Work to GitHub

When all tests are passing, the next step is to upload your work. To do this, we
need to complete three steps:

1. _Stage_ the work so it's ready to save
2. _Commit_ the work to actually save it
3. _Push_ the work up to GitHub

**Step 1** To stage the work, type the following, then press `<Enter>`:

```console
$ git add .
```

By typing this command, you're indicating that any work you've done (i.e., all
changes you've made to any of the files in your local copy of an assignment)
should be saved in the next step.

**Step 2**: To actually _save_ the changes, we run the following, then press
`<Enter>`:

```console
$ git commit -m 'Done with assignment'
```

This is known as creating a _commit_. A commit preserves all _staged_ changes
from the previous command. Any work you've done is now recorded as part of your
copy of the assignment. This copy, however, is still only on your local
environment.

**Step 3**: To upload your completed assignment, there is one final command to
run. Type the following, then press `<Enter>`:

```console
$ git push
```

This command sends the changes you've made to GitHub. If you revisit your
_personal_ copy of the assignment on GitHub, the commit you just created (with
the message 'Done with assignment') will be the most recent commit on the
assignment.

Each assignment will be slightly different and will include instructions on what
is required to complete it. Depending on the testing tools in an assignment, the
specific commands may change. For JavaScript and React labs, you will need to
run `npm install` to set up the necessary tools, and `npm test` to run the tests.
For Ruby and Rails labs, the corresponding commands are `bundle install` to
install the dependencies and `rspec` to run the tests. Each lab will include
instructions indicating which commands to run.

Once you've installed the dependencies, you can run `npm test` as many
times as you like. Some labs will have many tests and may require running the
tests many times while you solve them.

## Submitting Your Work To Canvas

To register completion of an assignment in Canvas, you must submit a link to
your GitHub repository.

1. After pushing your code up following the previous steps, go to your
   repository and copy the URL link in the browser's URL bar.

2. In Canvas, navigate to the assignment you've been working on. In the upper
   right corner of the assignment, you should see a **Submit Assignment**
   button. When you click it, you will be directed to a form at the bottom of
   the page where you can enter the URL as your submission.

3. Paste in your repository's GitHub URL in the box labeled "Website URL" and
   click **Submit Assignment**.

Canvas will indicate a successful submission and refresh the page. In the
Modules view of your course, you should now see a checkmark next to the
assignment, indicating a successful submission.

## Review

Let's quickly review the entire process for completing and submitting
assignments:

1. Create a personal fork of the GitHub assignment by clicking the **Fork**
   button in the upper right corner of the assignment on Canvas.

2. Once forked to your personal account, start the **cloning** for your
   assignment. Do this by clicking the **Code** button in GitHub, choosing
   **SSH**, then clicking the **clipboard** icon to copy the assignment's GitHub
   info.

3. Go to your local environment's terminal and navigate to where you'd like to
   store your assignment locally. Remember to make sure you aren't inside the
   directory for another assignment.

4. Type `git clone`, then paste in what you copied from GitHub. This will create
   a copy on your local machine.

5. Navigate into the new cloned assignment.

6. Install testing tools with `npm install` (or `bundle install` if tests use
   Ruby).

7. Run tests with `npm test` (or `rspec` for Ruby).

8. If all tests are passing, stage and commit your solution with the following
   commands:

```console
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Done with assignment'
```

9. Push your work to your personal fork on GitHub with the `git push` command.

10. Go to your repository in GitHub and copy the URL. It should be copied from
    the browser's address bar, and should start with `https://github.com/`

11. Go to the assignment in Canvas and click the **Submit Assignment** button.
    (Note: the button might instead say **Start Assignment**).

12. Paste your GitHub URL into the "Website URL" box.

13. Click "Submit Assignment".
